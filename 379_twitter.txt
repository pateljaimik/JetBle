b"@JetBlue Pretty much what I already know \xf0\x9f\xa4\xb7\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbd\xe2\x80\x8d\xe2\x99\x82\xef\xb8\x8f what I'd like to know is at what point the burden shifts from the passengers to the airline? Certain things are unavoidable, I get it, but the way #jetblue deals with the unavoidable leaves far to be desired #StepUp #BeBetter #YouLostACustomer"

b'Very displeased with #JetBlue. Lost my in-laws checked bag on the way to our destination (completely lost and not ever delivered after the fact). No one even cares to look for it after one week after it being lost. Now sitting on the airplane for 2 hours. Not flying tonight.'

b"@JetBlue jk jk, it's actually just a 5 hour delay instead with rebook fees at your own charge. Great. #FixItJesus #JetBlue #Flights #UnhappyCustomer"

b'@JetBlue The only thing worse than a flight cancellation is a flight cancellation after a 3 hour delay \xf0\x9f\x98\xab Is this 2019 or nah? #MSP #JetBlue #Flight #UnhappyCustomer'

b'@JetBlue And they actually reply to their social media accounts .... list keeps on going.  I thought all airlines had the dollar as what they served.  Seems #jetblue actually puts the customer first ! Wow \xf0\x9f\xa4\xa9'
